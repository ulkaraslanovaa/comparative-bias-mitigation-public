class Losses:
    """
    Losses class for computing the hybrid loss in Debiasify.

    This class implements three loss components:
      1. Averaged Cross-Entropy Loss (L_ACE)
         - Trains both the shallow and deep classifiers to predict the target label.
      2. KL Divergence Loss (L_KL)
         - Aligns the predictions (logits) of the shallow classifier with those of the deep classifier.
      3. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) Loss (L_MMD)
         - Aligns the distributions of shallow and deep features using a Gaussian RBF kernel.
    
    The total hybrid loss is given by:
         L_total = L_ACE + alpha * L_KL + L_MMD

    Default Parameters:
         - alpha: 0.1 (weight for the KL divergence loss), as specified in config.yaml.
         - sigma: 1.0 (bandwidth for the Gaussian RBF kernel)
